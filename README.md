# Personal config files

My organisation strategy here is to keep everything in $HOME/.config and symlink when necessary into $HOME. I'm keeping .vim and .vimrc as separate repos but install.sh will install them too

Things which I haven't configured will be in the gitignore for neatness


### Things which need fixing atm

- dpi
- some polybar metaconfigs not being set
- remove references to /home/tim where possible
