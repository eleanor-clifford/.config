\maketitle
<!--
   Keep the title meaningful and brief.
   Give the names of the authors, with all initials. [this is in the YAML]
   Give additional author detail as appropriate – e.g. college affiliation
    (for all Tripos coursework), subject group (for Part IIB projects), or full
	address of the Department and email contact (for reports going to
	industrial sponsors, journals).
-->


\begin{abstract}
\end{abstract}
<!--
   Try for 1-2 sentences on each of: motive (what it’s about), method (what
    was done), key results and conclusions (the main outcomes).
   Don’t exceed 3 sentences on any one.
   Write this last, when you know what it should say!
-->

# Introduction
<!--
   (sometimes also Background or Literature Review)
   What is the problem and why is it interesting?
   Who are the main previous contributors, and what did they do?
   What novel follow-up will the rest of your report present?
-->


# Method
<!--
   Experimental paper: equipment, materials, method
    Modelling paper: assumptions, mathematical tools, method
	Computational paper: inputs, computational tools, method
   Explain what is especially different about your method.
   Give sufficient detail that the reader could reproduce what you did, but no
    more.
   Don’t mix Method with Results or Discussion—they come next.
-->

# Results
<!--
   Present the output of the experiments, model or computation.
   Use meaningful precision in the data (i.e. think how many significant
    figures can be justified).
   Don’t mix Results with Discussion (almost always).
-->

# Discussion
<!--
   Extract principles, relationships, generalisations.
   Present analysis, model or theory.
   Show the relationships between the results and analysis, model or theory,
    and comment.
-->

# Conclusion
<!--
   Extract principles, relationships, generalisations.
   List any reservations or limitations.
-->

# Acknowledgements
<!--
   Thank people who helped you with ideas, technical assistance, materials or
    finance
   Keep it simple, give full names and affiliation, and don’t get sentimental
    or over-familar.
-->

# References
<!--
   Cite significant previous work.
   Cite sources of theories, data, or anything else you have taken from
    elsewhere.
   References must be complete: name, initials, year, title, journal, volume,
    start- page and finish-page.
   References to the Web should be given in full, including the date when
    accessed.

# Tables
<!--
   Tables summarise data (results, or parameters input to analysis).
   Externally sourced data must be referenced.
-->

# Figures
<!--
   Flow charts show methods, procedures.
   Graphs present data, or model output (e.g. as predicted curves).
   Schematics show how equipment works, or illustrate a physical mechanism.
   Drawings and photographs illustrate equipment, microstructures etc.
   Externally sourced figures must be referenced (and used with permission if
    published in the public domain).

   Essential material that would interrupt the flow of the main text.
